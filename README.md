# SQL Exercises


## Topics

- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Relational Databases
- SQLite
- Writing Basic Queries

## Assignment

For this lab you will:

- write SQL statements against a pre-populated database using an online tool. Once you have the correct SQL Statement for each query, write it inside the `queries.md` file under the appropriate heading.
- install [`SQLite Studio`](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt) and use it to create a database within this codebase.
- using `SQLite Studio` add a table to the database you just created.
- write API endpoints to interact with your database

### Write Basic Queries

Visit [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top) using the **Google Chrome (or Chromium if you use Linux) browser** and write _SQL queries_ for the following requirements:

- find all customers that live in London. Returns 6 records.

SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'London';

- find all customers with postal code 1010. Returns 3 customers.

SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE PostalCode =  1010;

- find the phone number for the supplier with the id 11. Should be (010) 9984510.

SELECT Phone FROM Suppliers WHERE SupplierID = 11;

- list orders descending by the order date. The order with date 1997-02-12 should be at the top.

SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;

- find all suppliers who have names longer than 20 characters. You can use `length(SupplierName)` to get the length of the name. Returns 11 records.

SELECT * FROM Suppliers WHERE LENGTH(SupplierName) > 20;


- find all customers that include the word "market" in the name. Should return 4 records.

SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%market%'

- add a customer record for _"The Shire"_, the contact name is _"Bilbo Baggins"_ the address is _"1 Hobbit-Hole"_ in _"Bag End"_, postal code _"111"_ and the country is _"Middle Earth"_.

INSERT into Customers(CustomerName, contactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
values ('The Shire', 'Bilbo Baggins', '1 Hobbit-Hole', 'Bag End', '111', 'Middle Earth');

- update _Bilbo Baggins_ record so that the postal code changes to _"11122"_.

UPDATE Customers set postalCode = '11122' where CustomerID = 92; 


** STRETCH
delete all customers that have no orders. Should delete 18 records.

list orders grouped by customer showing the number of orders per customer. Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery should have 7 orders.

list customers names and the number of orders per customer. Sort the list by number of orders in descending order. Ernst Handel should be at the top with 10 orders followed by QUICK-Stop, Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery and Wartian Herkku with 7 orders each.

list orders grouped by customer's city showing number of orders per city. Returns 58 Records with Aachen showing 2 orders and Albuquerque showing 7 orders.

**Clicking the `Restore Database` button in the page will repopulate the database with the original data and discard all changes you have made**.

### Create Database and Table

- use [`SQLite Studio`](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt) to create a database, name it `budget.db3` and save it in the `data` folder of this repository. **You must use this exact name and save it within the `data` folder or your `accounts-model` will not be able to connect.**
- add an `accounts` table with the following _schema_:

  - `id`, numeric value with no decimal places that should auto-increment.
  - `name`, string
  - `budget` numeric value.

- constraints
  - the `id` should be the primary key for the table.
  - account `name` should be required and unique.
  - account `budget` is required.

#### Database Access

Database access will be done using the `accounts-model.js` file included inside the `data` folder. This file publishes the following methods:

**All these methods are asynchronous and return a promise**.

- `find()`: calling `find` returns a promise that resolves with an array of all the accounts contained in the database.
- `findById()`: this method expects an `id` as it's only parameter and returns a promise that resolves with the account corresponding to the `id` provided or a _falsy_ value if an account with that `id` is not found.
- `add()`: calling add passing it a _account_ object will add it to the database and return a promise that resolves with the newly inserted _account_.
- `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the account to update and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. It returns a promise that resolves with the count of updated records. If the count is `1` it means the record was updated correctly.
- `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as it's first parameter and upon successfully deleting the account from the database it returns returns a promise that resolves with the number of records deleted.

Now that we have a way to add, update, remove and retrieve data from the provided database, it is time to work on the API.

### Write endpoints for the accounts resource

- Within `server.js` add CRUD endpoints for the account resource. You may use `data/accounts-model.js` for access to your newly created database. The methods included in the `accounts-model` are described above in the _Database Access_ section.
- Use these endpoints to manually test that your database is working as expected.

## Stretch Problems

The following exercises **require research**, the concepts needed to complete them have not been covered in class yet.

- delete all customers that have no orders. Should delete 18 records.
- list orders grouped by customer showing the number of orders per customer. _Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery_ should have 7 orders.
- list customers names and the number of orders per customer. Sort the list by number of orders in descending order. _Ernst Handel_ should be at the top with 10 orders followed by _QUICK-Stop_, _Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery_ and _Wartian Herkku_ with 7 orders each.
- list orders grouped by customer's city showing number of orders per city. Returns 58 Records with _Aachen_ showing 2 orders and _Albuquerque_ showing 7 orders.
